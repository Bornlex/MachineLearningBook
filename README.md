# Machine Learning Book

I decided to implement many machine learning algorithms in order to improve my resume with actual code.

Feel free to pull the code and use it. I try to explain a bit algorithms I implement in specific README files so there is
as little magic as possible.

## Algorithms

### Machine learning

- Neural network (perceptron)
- Bayesian classifier
- SVM
- Deep neural network (using Pytorch)

### Pattern mining

- A priori
- K-means

## Datasets

- MNIST
